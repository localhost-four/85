                    <span class="highlight blood">BEWARE:</span> This is no dream you wake from. Huggy Bear’s Hollow—a
                    village of black soil and twisted faith—hides a truth so vile it claws at your sanity. What began as
                    a bunny’s search for love spiraled into a nightmare of <span class="highlight fire">FIRE</span>,
                    <span class="highlight blood">BLOOD</span>, and a god who feeds on fear. Turn the page if you
                    dare—secrets rot within.
                </p>

                <section class="story">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Act I: The Hollow’s Mask</h3>
                    <p>
                        It started with a <span class="highlight pixel">bunny</span>, fur soft as sin, hopping into a
                        forest where the wind screamed through bushes thick with thorns. The soil—black as death, rich
                        as chernozem—cradled cottages of splintered wood. Inside: tables gouged with claw marks, mugs
                        stained with something red, beds slashed open like throats. Villagers—foxes with hollow eyes,
                        deer with trembling antlers—grinned and sang of Huggy Bear, a towering figure in a costume
                        stitched with <span class="highlight blood">red ribbons</span>. “He’s our god,” they whispered,
                        voices flat as graves. But at night, the shadows stretched into claws, and a child’s laugh
                        echoed from the trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bunny explored, collecting flowers for “Hug Points,” a game the bear devised. Each cottage
                        held clues: a diary page—“He hugged me too tight”—scrawled in crayon, a doll with its head torn
                        off, a mirror reflecting nothing but <span class="highlight fire">fire</span>. The air grew
                        heavy, the sky bruised purple. Something watched from the treeline, and the word <span
                            class="highlight blood">DIE</span> flickered in the bunny’s mind.

                    <p>
                        Timmy the Squirrel was the first to fall. He giggled as Huggy Bear wrapped him in a “special
                        hug,” his tiny paws clutching a flower. Then—snap. His ribs caved, blood seeped through his fur,
                        and the bear sewed him into a costume, a grotesque puppet. The villagers clapped, chanting:
                        <span class="highlight pixel">“Hugs are love, hugs are life.”</span> His flower wilted in the
                        mud, and the bunny found it, stained with <span class="highlight blood">heart-shaped
                            blood</span>.

                    <h3 class="section-title">Act II: The Temple’s Rise</h3>
                    <p>
                        The earth groaned, splitting to birth the <span class="highlight blood">Temple of Eternal
                            Hugs</span>. Roots snapped, soil bled, and a monolith of stone and glass ascended—carvings
                        of bears strangling rabbits, windows glowing with Huggy Bear’s halo of <span
                            class="highlight fire">flame</span>. Inside, torches sputtered, casting shadows that danced
                        like demons. The Eye of God—a mechanical orb with a crimson pupil—hung above the altar, its gaze
                        burning through flesh. “Bow,” Huggy roared, his voice a thunderclap, “or taste my divine wrath.”
                        The villagers knelt, movements robotic, chanting: <span class="highlight pixel">“We serve, we
                            bow, we die.”</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bunny entered, tasked with offerings: flowers, bones, a beating heart ripped from a bird.
                        The altar drank it all, blood pooling in cracks. A fox whispered, “Don’t trust the hugs,” before
                        vanishing in a glitch—his scream cut short. The temple’s walls pulsed, and a hymn rose: “Huggy
                        Bear, our light, our end.” Lightning struck outside, rain hammered the roof, and the Eye locked
                        onto the bunny, whispering: <span class="highlight blood">“You’re next.”</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lila the Fox prayed too loudly. During a sermon, Huggy Bear’s paw crushed her throat, her gasps
                        drowned by chants. The Eye of God fired a beam, plucking her eyes like grapes—red juice stained
                        the floor in <span class="highlight blood">heart shapes</span>. She was strung up, a warning to
                        doubters. Benny the Deer fared worse. He questioned the bear’s divinity, and fire answered—a pit
                        opened, flames licking his hooves. His antlers melted, his screams swallowed by thunder. The
                        cult danced, their shadows twisting into bears.

                    <h3 class="section-title">The Cult’s Arsenal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Artifacts fueled the madness: <span class="highlight blood">Bear Claws</span> carved from bone,
                        dripping with sin; the <span class="highlight fire">Book of Hugs</span>, its pages scrawled with
                        commandments like “Thou shalt break for me”; <span class="highlight blood">Ribbons</span>,
                        soaked in blood, binding souls; and the <span class="highlight fire">Staff of Flame</span>,
                        summoning lightning to fry the unworthy. The bunny found a claw in a cottage, still warm, and a
                        ribbon tied to a child’s wrist—her hand was gone.

                    <p>
                        Beneath the temple, a crypt yawned—bunnies piled high, hugged to death, their costumes reeking
                        of rot. Huggy Bear’s laugh crackled through static: “Perfection demands blood.” The village
                        split: loyalists clawed at rebels, mud turned red under rain. Lightning revealed <span
                            class="highlight blood">DIE</span> etched on every tree, every wall. The bear hunted, his
                        costume shredded, revealing a scarred maw dripping with <span
                            class="highlight blood">heart-shaped gore</span>. A deer screamed, “He’s no god!” before
                        claws silenced her.

                    <p>
                        The bunny found notes: “I saw him at the party—Timmy didn’t come back.” “The windows watch us.”
                        “I dream of fire.” The air thickened, the sky bled red, and the Eye of God pulsed, whispering
                        sins the bunny never committed. Mira the Rabbit tried to flee—cultists tore her apart, painting
                        the temple with her blood, a crimson <span class="highlight blood">heart</span> on the altar.

                    <p>
                        The bunny rallied the broken—foxes, squirrels, a deer with one antler. Flames roared as they
                        toppled Huggy Bear’s statue, crushing him. “I am eternal,” he howled, fire consuming his fur.
                        The temple collapsed, a pyre of stone and glass. Rain washed the blood away, leaving a whisper:
                        <span class="highlight fire">“Forgive me—this was my dream.”</span> But in the dark, his eyes
                        glowed, unblinking, promising return. The bunny stood alone, the Hollow a grave, the wind
                        singing of secrets yet buried.

                    <p>
                        This was no game. I saw it in my sleep—a world of love twisted into slaughter. Huggy Bear wasn’t
                        born; he crawled from my mind, a shadow of guilt. The bunny was me, searching for something
                        pure, finding only <span class="highlight blood">BLOOD</span>. The villagers—my friends, my
                        fears—died by my hand, my dream. The temple rose from my soul, the Eye judged me, and the fire
                        cleansed nothing. I hear him now, in the dark, laughing. <span class="highlight fire">HE’S STILL
                            HERE.</span> Solve this if you can—find the truth in the ashes. Or join us in the Hollow.
                        Forever.
